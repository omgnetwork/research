# OMG Plasma UX

This document maps out the basic UX of the OMG network Plasma chain. 


## User Interactions

### Depositing

Users can move funds from Ethereum to the Plasma chain by depositing their funds into the Plasma smart contract.
Luckily, this takes the form of an Ethereum transaction.
We can take advantage of existing integrations (MetaMask) for deposits.


### Viewing Balances

Users should be able to easily query and view their balances.
We plan to include a state tree in each block that aggregates UTXOs by some standard method (e.g. UTXOs by address).
Light clients should be able to ask for pieces of this tree to retrieve UTXOs for a single address.
In comparison to Bitcoin, this vastly simplifies the process of querying all UTXOs owned by a specific user.

### Simple Transfers

Users are allowed to make simple transfers, whereby money is sent from one user directly to another, without the need for an exchange.
Transfers reference a set of UTXOs to be spent and list a new set of UTXOs to be created.
Each input points to a unique UTXO identifier, each output specifies an owner and an amount.
The difference between the total input value and total output value is considered the transaction fee.
Transactions are signed on a user’s machine and sent to a node, where they’re broadcast and eventually included in a block.

If a user doesn’t own all of the inputs to a transaction, it may be necessary to cache transactions until all of the signatures are received.
These cases should probably be handled on the DApp level. 


### Exchange Transfers

Users can also make exchange transfers to exchange one asset for another.
Exchange transfers are very similar to simple transfers, except that they specify some order parameters.
Exchanges can also be cancelled any time before they’re included in the Plasma chain.
A successfully cancelled trade will not execute.  


### Exits

Users can withdraw their funds at any time by submitting an “exit” transaction to the Plasma contract on Ethereum.
When the consensus mechanism is functioning properly, users can withdraw at their earliest convenience.
However, if the chain is faulty, it may be necessary for the user to exit within some short period of time (~ 1 week).
Clients should alert users in as many ways possible (notification, email, text, etc.) if such a fault ever occurs.
Opt-in alerts and easy exits via MetaMask (or maybe opt-out for any chains on which the user has funds) would likely improve the UX of these events.


## Further Considerations

### Diverse UX

Anyone attempting a strong UX integration should consider that Plasma chains are highly diverse.
The format and impact of transactions can differ greatly between implementations.
This difference is evident when comparing Plasma MVP and Plasma Cash - the design of Plasma Cash makes it much more light-client friendly but also less suited to arbitrary exchange.
It’s therefore unlikely that we can create a standardized interface for *all* Plasma chains.
It’s probably more reasonable to create an interface to a few widely used designs.
